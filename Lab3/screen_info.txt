Attached file is a sample code of how to control backlight and display text on LCD module. Using the module directly is not 
well documented (at least I didn't find any documentation). 
So Dr. ChrisP and we think it is necessary to have this sample code.

The module is a character display, which means dot matrix is grouped and separated by a gap, so it is not suitable for graphics. 
The whole screen can display 16 characters * 2 lines, 32 characters in total. The communication is using I2C protocol. 
It has two I2C addresses, one for backlight, the other for text display. 
As its name indicates, backlight is not monochromatic like other common LCD's. 
You can control the backlight color by sending RGB color components to backlight I2C address. 
Different intensity/brightness is controlled by PWM (PWM is already builtin to the module). 
Text display is achieved by sending characters and "special" (moving cursor) commands.


The sample code also shows a way to handle sigInt (Ctrl+C), which is the addendum of assignment 1. 
Since you already finish that part, it's okay to include it here.

The sample code is well commented. But if you still have any question, of course we can discuss it.

*The underlying communication of LCD is SPI, which requires more wires than I2C. 
There is a builtin I2C chip on this RGB LCD module, which do all the communication protocol conversion job for you.
